# Machine Learning based Predictive Maintenance of Turbofan Engine........
After Learning core Python as well as Advance Python course I started learning machine learning so I prepared one of MY Mega Project on Predictions of Turbo fan Engine I collected dataset via cloud. Also I have taken reading on Digital lathe machine from My college and I prepared one observative report on that digital lathe machine so I can make machine learning algorithm to predict the accuracy of working that engine effectively. Predictions are basically made to reduce the downtime, condition monitoring and for improving performance also to work effectively in safe environment. Sensors are placed on that digital lathe machine also on the turbofan engine like pressure sensors, humidity sensors, rpm speed sensors, temperature sensors to collect data from the software in certain time perod. Thoroughly machine can be monitored for specific amount of readings to predict the accuracy and check how machine can perform well without downfall.
